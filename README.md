### What I learned

Based on some CSS issues reported in a previous project, I learned about `prefers-reduced-motion` feature, used to detect user device settings about of motion/amimations.

```
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .animation {
    ...
  }
}
```

### Useful resources

- [prefers-reduced-motion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/At-rules/@media/prefers-reduced-motion) - MDN resource about this CSS media feature.
